SECURITY CERTIFICATE SETUP
---------------------------
Connect to RUT_xxx_2G WiFi first, then download certs from the
local server at soul.local:3000/certs/

  Windows:     Download install-windows.bat → Right-click → "Run as administrator"
               (If SmartScreen blocks it: click "More info" → "Run anyway")
  Mac:         Download install-mac.command → Double-click, enter password
  Chromebook:  Download SOUL-Learning-CA.crt → chrome://settings/certificates
               → Authorities → Import → Trust for websites
  iPad:        Download install-ios.mobileconfig → Settings → enable trust

Mac extra step (Ventura+):
  System Settings → Privacy & Security → Profiles → install the profile

iPad extra step:
  Settings → General → About → Certificate Trust Settings
  → Enable full trust for "SOUL Learning CA"

Certificate files are served locally from soul.local:3000/certs/
No internet connection needed!


STUDENT SETUP (4 Steps - No Internet Needed!)
----------------------------------------------
Students just need to:
1. Connect to WiFi network RUT_xxx_2G (give them the password)
2. Open Chrome and type: soul.local:3000
3. Download and install the security certificate for their device
4. Click "Install" when prompted — SOUL icon appears in their apps!

Everything downloads from the SOUL Tower. No internet required.


OPTIONAL: CAPTIVE PORTAL SETUP
------------------------------
To make it even easier (auto-opens SOUL when connecting to WiFi):

1. Access Teltonika router admin:
   - Open browser: http://172.20.10.1
   - Login with admin credentials

2. Navigate to: Services → Hotspot → General

3. Enable Hotspot mode

4. Set Landing Page settings:
