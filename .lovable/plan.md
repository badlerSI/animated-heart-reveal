# Update The Heavy Product Page

## Overview
Update specs, remove case blurb, and rework the CTA section to emphasize ownership and control rather than luxury investment.

---

## Changes

### 1. Combine Storage Specs into One
**Current (two entries):**
- Primary Storage: "4TB Gen 5 SSD for instant model switching"
- Backup Storage: "4TB Gen 4 SSD for redundancy"

**New (single entry):**
- Storage: "8TB total: Gen 5 + Gen 4 SSDs. Hot swap models at blazing speed."

### 2. Remove Case Spec
Delete the "Case" entry entirely (lines 51-54). The portability spec already exists and the wood/emblem details are covered in the hero subtitle.

### 3. Rework CTA Section
**Current:**
- Title: "Timeless Investment"
- Subtitle: "Own a piece of the future, crafted for generations."

**New:**
- Title: "Your Infrastructure, Your Rules"
- Subtitle: "No subscriptions. No cloud. Just the power to run AI on your terms."

This ties directly into Soul Interface's sovereign AI positioning and emphasizes ownership/control rather than luxury.
